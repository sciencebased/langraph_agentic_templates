,10.1093/aje/kwaf223,Improving classification of myocardial infarction with machine learning in a diverse population.,"Phenotype classification with electronic health record (EHR) data is increasingly performed with ML, however their performance in diverse populations remains understudied. We compared an ICD-based algorithm with an ML phenotyping pipeline to classify myocardial infarction (MI) in a general and self-reported Black population. We determined the impact of differential performance by replicating a published MI risk factor study with MI defined by the ICD or ML algorithms. Individuals followed in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) EHR with data from 2002 to 2019 were examined: 11,523,175 Veterans, mean age 67.5 years, 93.8% male, 14.3% Black, 79.1% White. MI was classified using a published rule-based ICD algorithm and an ML pipeline, PheCAP which incorporates natural language processing. Algorithms were trained and validated against n=403 Veterans randomly selected and chart-reviewed for MI (gold standard), oversampled for self-reported Black. Among chart-reviewed Veterans, the ICD algorithm had high PPV and low sensitivity (all race, PPV:0.97, sensitivity:0.17; Black Veterans, PPV:0.94, sensitivity:0.24). PheCAP MI had good PPV and higher sensitivity (all race, PPV:0.90, sensitivity:0.66; Black, PPV:0.81, sensitivity:0.79). Applying PheCAP MI to the entire VHA population to classify MI provided increased power to replicate findings from the published MI risk factor study compared to the ICD algorithm.",American journal of epidemiology,,"['AliciaChen', 'ChuanHong', 'Yuk LamHo', 'NicholasLink', 'Jacqueline PHonerlaw', 'VidishaTanukonda', 'Ariela ROrkaby', 'SaadiaQazi', 'ConnorMelley', 'AshleyGalloway', 'LaurenCosta', 'MonikaMaripuri', 'XuanWang', 'YichiZhang', 'PetraSchubert', 'TianrunCai', 'ZelingHe', 'Vidul APanickan', 'MorganRosser', 'LauraTarko', 'SharonDowell', 'CandaceFeldman', 'GailKerr', 'J MichaelGaziano', 'Peter W FWilson', 'KellyCho', 'TianxiCai', 'Katherine PLiao']",,,PubMed,

These advancements include predictive modelling, machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices, and data visualization tools. This review aims to examine the current state of data-driven methods in orthopaedic surgery, highlight their clinical impact, and address existing challenges and future directions.
A comprehensive literature search was conducted across databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies exploring data-driven technologies' applications in orthopaedic settings. The analysis focused on preoperative planning, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative monitoring while considering ethical concerns and implementation challenges in low and middle-income countries.
The findings indicate that 3D imaging and patient-specific surgical guides enhance preoperative planning, improving accuracy and reducing surgical errors. Robot-assisted systems provide real-time intraoperative support, leading to better precision and reduced recovery times. Postoperative monitoring through wearable devices enables continuous patient tracking, allowing for early detection of complications and improved patient engagement. However, challenges related to data privacy, interoperability, and ethical considerations persist, potentially hindering broader adoption.
Integrating data-driven technologies is promising for advancing orthopaedic surgery by improving patient outcomes and surgical success rates. Addressing the identified challenges through ongoing research and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for facilitating the effective implementation of these innovations in clinical practice. Future studies should focus on using data-driven technologies and ethical guidelines to improve orthopaedic outcomes and overcome challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

This study aims to investigate the predictive value of SIRI for 28-day outcomes in sepsis patients, and develop and validate a prognostic model for 28-day mortality.
The demographic characteristics, disease severity, laboratory tests, treatments, and outcome measures were recorded from the adult sepsis patients. The restricted cubic splines and the ROC curve analysis were employed to evaluate the relationship and predictive capability of SIRI. Next, SIRI was categorized into tertiles, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to assess its association with prognosis, supplemented by Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves, and compare mortality differences. Patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University were randomly allocated into training and internal validation sets at a 3:1 ratio, using the Boruta algorithm and LASSO regression and a prognostic model was constructed via logistic regression, while patients from the First People's Hospital of Zhangjiagang City served as the external validation set. Then, the predictive performance, accuracy, and clinical utility of the model were validated using the ROC curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
The 380 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and 240 patients from the First People's Hospital of Zhangjiagang City were enrolled for the present study. The restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a nonlinear increasing trend in mortality risk with rising SIRI levels. The ROC curve analysis demonstrated that SIRI has superior predictive capability than the APACHE II and SOFA scores. When SIRI was categorized into tertiles, both the univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses identified SIRI as significantly associated to 28-day prognosis (

This highlights an urgent need for reliable biomarkers to facilitate early detection and effective management of recurrent or metastatic cases. Leveraging multi-omics analysis, we identified the HOX gene family as significantly overexpressed and closely associated with OSCC progression. Among these, HOXC9 was prioritized as a key regulator using machine learning algorithms. Mechanistic investigations revealed a strong correlation between HOXC9 expression and DNA hypomethylation at the CDX1 motif, which play a crucial role in regulating MMP13 expression. Single-cell RNA sequencing further elucidated the role of HOXC9 in driving OSCC malignant transformation. Clinical evidence demonstrates that HOXC9 promotes OSCC invasion and metastasis through the ITGA6/PI3K/Akt/MMP13 signaling axis. Additionally, HOXC9 expression appears to be modulated by miR-196, presenting a potential target for therapeutic intervention in OSCC.",iScience,,"['MengyuXu', 'ZewenSun', 'DandanWang', 'GuoxinLi', 'WeiFeng', 'ChunyanQiao', 'CeShi', 'QilinLiu', 'PengChen', 'ZhengwenAn']",,,PubMed,

These processes have the potential to enhance the quality and accuracy of data collections, save resources and accelerate research.
To evaluate the use of automated clinical coding in the United Kingdom (UK) and European cancer registries.
An online electronic survey was formulated to evaluate the use and user opinion of automation within cancer registries. The survey was distributed to members of the United Kingdom and Ireland Association of Cancer Registry and the European cancer registries. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2015
Twenty-three of the 117 cancer registries responded to the distributed survey; 15 (12.8%) cancer registries used automation within their registry, mainly in the form of natural language processing or machine learning. Most of the sampled registries (73.3%) used these technologies to automate data collection from pathology reports; 87% of respondents reported automation as efficient; and 26.1% reported improved data quality; 12 (52.1%) of cancer registries still manually checked all the automations; and 17 (74%) respondents believed that the algorithms for difficult tasks require further development.
Various computer-based algorithms have been used for automated clinical coding in the UK and European cancer registries in the past few decades; however, to date there are no published data to validate its use. Further research and development of these technologies is needed to ensure external validity and maximise the potential use within other cancer registries globally.Implications for health information management practice:It is clear that while automation can be advantageous in areas of clinical coding, the role of the ""human"" (HIMs and clinical coders) in coding and classifying registry data, and in overseeing the transition, will be required for some time yet.",Health information management : journal of the Health Information Management Association of Australia,,"['ManuelaRoman', 'StephenAli', 'NaderIbrahim', 'Thomas DDobbs', 'HayleyHutchings', 'Iain SWhitaker']",,,PubMed,

Patients were randomly stratified into train and test sets in a 7:3 ratio. Radiomics features were extracted from enhanced CT images of mediastinal lymph nodes, followed by feature selection using univariate analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. A support vector machine algorithm was used to develop classification models, with performance evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), accuracy, and 95% CI.
For differentiating mediastinal lymphadenopathy between hematologic malignancies and abdominopelvic solid cancers, the model incorporated 23 features and achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.931 (95% CI: 0.891-0.971) and an accuracy of 0.866 in the train set, and an AUC-ROC of 0.830 (95% CI: 0.730-0.929) and an accuracy of 0.759 in the test set.

Twenty-two healthy adults (ages 20-53, both sexes, varying fitness levels) participated in this study to examine the effects of 3 activity levels on heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure, and arterial oxygen saturation (peripheral oxygen saturation). The activities levels were sitting (rest), walking (~3 metabolic equivalents of tasks), and running (~7 metabolic equivalents of tasks), and each lasted roughly 5 minutes. For ongoing physiological monitoring, participants wore a specially designed multi-sensor device that combined force, photoplethysmography, inertial measurement unit, and electrocardiogram sensors. The physiological signals utilized in this investigation were supplemented by internal sensor validation and sourced from open-source datasets made available through PhysioNet. Higher activity intensity was associated with significant increases in HR (P < .001) and SBP (P < .01), according to repeated measures analysis of variance. HR increased stepwise across all activity conditions, while SBP significantly rose from sitting to running. Peripheral oxygen saturation values showed a slight postexercise decline, among older participants (P = .03), but they stayed within normal ranges (>95%). Age and weight were found to have moderate relationships with cardiovascular responses, specifically SBP, according to regression analysis. The random forest model's low predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.057) when predicting HR from physiological and demographic inputs emphasized the necessity for additional behavioral or contextual data. These results demonstrate the impact of age gender weight and body mass index on cardiovascular dynamics while showcasing how multi-sensor wearables detect individual physiological responses.

Traditional signal processing approaches demonstrate limited robustness when confronted with noise artifacts, baseline drift, and morphological variations commonly encountered in clinical recordings. This study introduces a novel deep residual U-Net (ResU-Net) architecture specifically designed for robust R-peak detection in noisy ECG signals, addressing the critical challenge of maintaining high detection accuracy across diverse noise conditions and patient populations. We developed an innovative deep learning framework combining the strengths of residual networks and U-Net architecture for precise R-peak localization. The proposed ResU-Net model incorporates skip connections, multi-scale feature extraction, and attention mechanisms to enhance feature representation. The architecture was trained and evaluated using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database, INCART database, and QT database, with comprehensive noise stress testing performed using the MIT-BIH noise stress test database. Data augmentation strategies including synthetic noise injection and morphological variations were employed to enhance model generalization. The ResU-Net architecture achieved superior performance compared to traditional signal processing methods (Pan-Tompkins, Hamilton-Tompkins algorithms) and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches (1D convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM)-CNN, ResNet-18) with sensitivity of 99.76%, positive predictive value of 99.82%, and F1-score of 99.79% on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Cross-database validation demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities with sensitivity values of 99.45% (INCART) and 99.38% (QT database). Under severe noise conditions (-6 dB signal-to-noise ratio), the model maintained sensitivity above 98.2%, significantly outperforming conventional algorithms and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

Acupuncture, an integrative therapy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has shown efficacy in the clinical treatment of RA, but its molecular mechanisms remain unclear.
This study systematically elucidated the holistic regulatory effects of acupuncture on RA by integrating network topology with machine learning approaches.
Data on the interactions between acupuncture-affected endogenous compounds and RA-related targets were extracted from databases, and a multidimensional interaction network was constructed to map the interactions between acupuncture and RA. screened RA-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the GEOdatabase that intersected with acupuncture-responsive genes. The clusterProfiler was used for KEGG/GO enrichment analysis of these DEGs, and the immune microenvironment was analyzed via the CIBERSORTx and xCell algorithms. ConsensusClusterPlus (R package) was used for unsupervised clustering to obtain DEGs. Subsequently, key genes were identified via an ensemble machine learning model (GLM/SVM/XGB/RF), and nomograms were created. Two-sample MR and colocalization analyses were applied to validate the causal relationship between core acupuncture-affected DEGs and RA risk.
This study identified 10 acupuncture-regulated endogenous compounds and 49 RA-related DEGs. KEGG analysis revealed that the DEGs enriched in immune pathways included the JAK/STAT pathway, which mediates inflammatory responses, the T-cell receptor signaling pathway, which is involved in T-cell differentiation, and the TNF signaling pathway. Immunome profiling via the CIBERSORT algorithm revealed that the DEGs were enriched primarily in key immune cell subpopulations, such as M1 macrophages, activated CD4⁺ T cells, Tregs, and B lymphocytes. Machine learning identified five key genes associated with immune infiltration (STAT1, GAPDH, JAK2, PTGS2, and MDM2). MR/colocalization confirmed that acupuncture-regulated STAT1 expression was positively correlated with RA genetic susceptibility, highlighting that the STAT1-mediated JAK/STAT pathway is involved in immune remodeling.

In this study, the mechanical effects of different implant designs and biomaterials on obliquely fractured tibia were analyzed. In addition, it was aimed to evaluate the data obtained from finite element analysis (FEA) with machine learning (ML) algorithms.
Seven implant models for tibial shaft fractures were analyzed using static structural simulations in Ansys Workbench. Implants and cortical screws were made of Ti-6Al-4 V alloy or 316 L stainless steel (SS), and axial loads of 600, 800, and 1000 N simulated single-leg stance. A dataset of 1008 points, including maximum stress and total displacement, was generated and used to train Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) models in WEKA.
The mechanical behaviors of different implant and biomaterial combinations were compared, and the maximum stress value in implants with 316 L SS material properties was higher than the maximum stress value in Ti-6Al-4 V alloy implants. When the total displacement values ​​in the tibia fracture region were examined, 316 L SS implants gave better results. In the machine learning estimations, the SVM model outperformed the MLP and DT algorithms. For maximum stress prediction, SVM achieved an mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.24 and 0.41 for the training and test sets, respectively, while MLP and DT showed higher errors (3.27/4.02 and 10.99/14.90, respectively).

Accurate staging of mediastinal lymph nodes is a crucial step in determining appropriate treatment approaches. Current noninvasive diagnostic methods do not provide sufficient accuracy to confidently decide on surgery without histological confirmation. Our study aimed to develop a artificial intelligence model for the precise prediction of N2 lymph node metastasis.
We retrospectively analyzed 1489 patients who underwent standard cervical mediastinoscopy at our department, including 472 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer. We developed three distinct prediction models for N2 lymph node station metastasis: one using standard statistical analysis, another utilizing an image processing deep learning algorithm with thoracic CT, and the third employing various machine learning methods with clinicopathological and radiological data. We compared diagnostic accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity rates, as well as the F1-score of all models.

The study evaluates advances in deep learning performance, clinical integration potential, dataset limitations, and the contributions of multimodal imaging and Explainable AI (XAI) to diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making.
We conducted a PRISMA-compliant systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore, including peer-reviewed English-language studies published from January 1990 to February 2024 that reported quantitative deep learning metrics for CSCR diagnosis. A two-stage selection process was applied (Cohen's κ = 0.84), resulting in 96 studies for analysis. Risk of bias was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool, and data were synthesized by imaging modality, model architecture, and diagnostic task.
Deep learning models demonstrate exceptional performance in CSCR diagnosis. DenseNet architectures applied to optical coherence tomography (OCT) images achieved peak Metrics, including 99.78% accuracy, 99.68% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. Segmentation models for subretinal fluid (SRF) reported Dice scores of up to 0.965, while multimodal models for differential diagnosis achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.999. Despite these advances, clinical adoption remains limited by several challenges: scarce and imbalanced datasets (e.g., SRF/non-SRF ratio of 1:8), lack of open-access datasets and models, risks of overfitting, and insufficient external validation. Emerging approaches, such as few-shot learning and diffusion models, are promising for mitigating data constraints; however, improvements in dataset quality and the implementation of rigorous cross-institutional validation are essential for real-world deployment.
By leveraging OCT and multimodal imaging data, deep learning has the potential to transform CSCR diagnosis through enhanced accuracy and automation. However, translating these advances into routine clinical practice necessitates overcoming key challenges, including limited and heterogeneous datasets and models with restricted generalizability. Future research should prioritize standardized reporting frameworks, transparent model interpretability through XAI, and rigorous large-scale validation. Essential strategies include employing federated learning to leverage distributed data, implementing effective multimodal fusion techniques, and fostering collaborative frameworks to improve diagnostic accuracy, ensure algorithmic fairness, and enable real-world clinical applicability.",BMC ophthalmology,,"['MohammadShojaeinia', 'AzamossadatHosseini', 'MostafaNaderi', 'BardiaBaloutch', 'Mohammad ShokoohiYekta', 'LeilaAkbarpour', 'HamidMoghaddasi']",,,PubMed,

Early screening for chemotoxicity risk is vital, yet comprehensive predictive models are lacking. The objective of this study was to develop effective artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) models, integrating racialized group, social determinants of health (SDOH) (Area Deprivation Index [ADI], employment status), and biological aging (Levine Phenotypic Age) to predict overall, gastrointestinal (GI), and hematological chemotoxicity.
We used electronic health records data from 1,735 adult patients with CRC. Sociodemographic/clinical variables, Levine Phenotypic Age (biological aging), and SDOH (including geospatial variations measured by ADI) were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Associations with chemotoxicity (overall, GI, hematological) were evaluated via univariate tests. Significant predictors from univariate tests were selected for AI/ML modeling. Six supervised ML models were trained on 80% of cases (n = 1,388), with 20% (n = 347) reserved for testing. Performance was assessed via accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and F1-score. Permutation feature importance ranked predictors to define the most significant predictors of chemotoxicity.
Support Vector Machine and XGBoost models demonstrated high accuracy in both the training and test datasets. Notably, the AUC (0.988) was highest for the Support Vector Machine model in predicting overall chemotoxicity within the training dataset. Key predictors of overall and GI toxicities included higher Levine Phenotypic Age, elevated inflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein), and poor SDOH (e.g., higher ADI, unemployment). Hematological toxicity was linked to lower inflammatory markers, higher Levine Phenotypic Age, and younger chronological age. Race (non-Hispanic Black), body mass index, and lifestyle also influenced overall and GI toxicities.
ML-based chemotoxicity prediction models incorporating racialized group, SDOH, and biological aging had high accuracy. Greater biological aging, poor SDOH including ADI, and higher inflammation markers were common risk factors for overall and GI chemotoxicity. In contrast, chronological and biological ages and immune/inflammation markers were only linked to hematological chemotoxicity. Integrating these factors into predictive models can help clinicians identify at-risk patients and tailor interventions (e.g., anti-inflammatory, anti-aging strategies) to reduce chemotoxicity and improve survivorship outcomes.",BMC cancer,,"['ClaireHan', 'ChristinBurd', 'JessePlascak', 'FodeTounkara', 'AshleyRosko', 'AnneNoonan', 'AlaiTan', 'Diane VonAh', 'XiaNing']",,,PubMed,

This study aims to further validate the diagnostic value of CST4 in colorectal cancer using random forest models in machine learning based on existing research.
First, the expression of CST4 in CRC patients is analyzed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the results show that CST4 is significantly high expression in CRC patients. To further investigate the diagnostic value of CST4, this retrospective study include 59 colorectal cancer patients, 51 patients with colorectal precancerous lesions and 40 patients with non-adenomatous polyps who visited Chaohu Hospital Affiliated to Anhui Medical University from August 2022 to September 2023. Their serum was collected and the CST4 level was detected by the double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. At the same time, CEA and CA199 were also tested.
Analysis of the TCGA database show that CST4 is significantly over expressed in colorectal cancer tissues, including colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ). Serum tests confirm that CST4 levels in CRC patients are significantly higher than those in the precancerous lesion and the polyp group (P < 0.001). However, no significant difference is observed between the precancerous lesion and polyp group. In the ROC curve, the area under the curve (AUC) of CST4 is 0.768 in the CRC group versus the precancerous lesion group and 0.769 in the CRC group versus the polyp group, which is significantly higher than that of CEA (AUC = 0.651/0.659) and CA199 (AUC = 0.486/0.601). In the diagnostic model constructed based on CST4, CEA and CA199, CST4 has the highest weight in differentiating CRC, further confirming its diagnostic value.
The study indicates that CST4 has a higher diagnostic value in colorectal cancer (CRC) and CST4 provides a new approach for early clinical diagnosis.",BMC gastroenterology,,"['YuanLan', 'LiZhang', 'RenjunLi']",,,PubMed,

A retrospective cohort of 418 adult glioma patients was partitioned into training (70%) and internal validation (30%) sets. (Support Vector Machine) SVM was selected as the optimal model after comparing 9 machine learning models. Six clinically significant features, ranked by predictive importance, were incorporated into the final SVM model. The model's generalizability was further validated using an independent external cohort (n = 206).
The SVM model demonstrated high discriminative performance, achieving an (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) AUC-ROC of 0.860 (internal validation) and 0.869 (external validation). SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis confirmed age as the most influential predictor, followed by edema and enhanced features, aligning with known biological associations in IDH-mutant LGGs.

Accurately predicting HT can significantly improve patient management and treatment outcomes. This study aims to develop and evaluate interpretable machine learning models that use radiomic and dosimetric features to predict HT in advanced cervical cancer patients.
Retrospectively collected general clinical data, planning CT images, and dose files from 205 patients with advanced cervical cancer who underwent chemoradiotherapy, and classified them according to the severity of HT. Radiomics and dosiomics features were extracted from the same region of interest, and feature selection was performed using a random forest algorithm. Radiomics models, dosiomics models, and hybrid models were then constructed based on extreme gradient boosting trees. Sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated to evaluate the classification performance of the models. Finally, SHAP values were used to perform interpretability analysis on the best model to enhance the transparency and practicality of the model.
The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values for the radiomics model were 0.42, 0.86, and 0.78, respectively, while those for the dosiomics model were 0.50, 0.90, and 0.74. In contrast, the hybrid model exhibited superior classification performance with sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values of 0.50, 0.83, and 0.83, respectively. Compared to the standalone radiomics and dosiomics models, the hybrid model demonstrated enhanced classification capability. Interpretability analysis based on SHAP values not only provided a ranking of feature importance and the distribution of feature impacts on model outputs but also elucidated the specific decision-making processes influenced by these features and the interactions between them. This enables clinicians to gain a more intuitive understanding of the model's decisions.
For patients with advanced cervical cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy, the integration of radiomics and dosiomics features can significantly enhance the classification performance of predictive models, thereby holding considerable potential for refining patient treatment strategies. Interpretability analysis based on SHAP values can aid clinicians in more readily understanding the model's decisions, thus promoting the effective implementation of the model in clinical practice.",BMC cancer,,"['JunZhu', 'QionghuiZhou', 'LuqiaoChen', 'ZhipengHe', 'JianfengTan', 'JinmengPang', 'QianxiNi']",,,PubMed,

The limitations of conventional anticancer therapies caused by the lack of tissue selectivity, demands urgent development of safer and more selective therapies to target tumors. Identifying the fundamental cancer hallmarks provided a comprehensive understanding of cancer biology for effective tumor targeting, encompassing tumor-promoting inflammation, metabolic reprogramming, immune evasion, genomic instability, phenotypic plasticity, epigenetic reprogramming, and polymorphic microbiomes. Moreover, drug repurposing is a cost-effective and time-saving method for cancer therapy that accelerates the drug discovery process by reusing drugs for new indications. Current research is focusing on combining drug repurposing with nanocarriers that enhance tumor targeting, reduce the side effects, and improve the bioavailability of the drug in a single nanoformulation. This article analyzes various types of nanoparticles encapsulating different classes of drugs, such as phenelzine, fexofenadine, telmisartan, losartan, metformin, canagliflozin, atorvastatin, and fenbendazole, highlighting their anticancer effects and the influence of nanocarriers on the drug's therapeutic effect. Results revealed that drug-encapsulated nanoparticles enhanced antitumor effects compared to the free drug solutions. This is attributed to the synergism from the nanocarrier's functionalization, sustained drug release, and improved cellular uptake within tumors that leads to targeting multiple cancer hallmarks. Additionally, this review highlights the present challenges in the clinical translation of nanoformulation and demonstrates how artificial intelligence may facilitate drug screening and identification, therapeutic optimization, and large-scale manufacture.

This study investigates alterations in brain module organization associated with FTD subtypes using connectome analysis, aiming to identify potential biomarkers and enhance subtype prediction. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained from 41 individuals with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (BV-FTD), 32 with semantic variant frontotemporal dementia (SV-FTD), 28 with progressive non-fluent aphasia frontotemporal dementia (PNFA-FTD), and 94 healthy controls. Individual functional brain networks were constructed at the voxel level and binarized based on density thresholds. Modular segregation index (MSI) and participation coefficient (PC) were calculated to assess module integrity and identify regions with altered nodal properties. The relationship between modular measures and clinical scores was examined, and machine learning models were developed for subtype prediction. Both BV-FTD and SV-FTD groups exhibited decreased MSI in the subcortical module (SUB), default mode network (DMN), and ventral attention network (VAN) compared to healthy controls. Additionally, BV-FTD specifically displayed disrupted frontoparietal network (FPN) integrity compared to other FTD subtypes and controls. All FTD subtypes showed increased PC values in the insular region and reduced connections between the insular and VAN/FPN compared to controls.

Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are metastatic precursors shed from primary tumours, which survive in circulation, extravasate and colonise distant organs. The advent of high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionised the investigation of transcriptomic landscape at single-cell resolution, enabling deep transcriptomic profiling, re-stratifying CTC subtypes and improving the detection of rare new subpopulations. Applications extend to understanding tumour microenvironments, characterising cellular heterogeneity, uncovering metastasis molecular mechanisms and improving prognosis and diagnostic strategies. A timeline of key milestones in CTC scRNA-seq research is also provided. Nevertheless, a knowledge gap remains due to unstandardised protocols and fragmented resources in CTC scRNA-seq research. We address this gap by proposing a 12-step CTC-specific scRNA-seq workflow to overcome methodological inconsistencies. This workflow spans the entire process from enrichment, single-cell sorting and sequencing to data pre-processing and downstream analyses, with a detailed compilation of data analysis tools. An in-depth discussion of the pros and cons of commonly used scRNA-seq tools is also included, specifically evaluating their suitability for CTC research. Additionally, emerging research frontiers, including the discovery of hybrid cells-fusion products of tumour and normal cells-and the integration of machine learning (ML) into scRNA-seq workflows, are explored. Future research should prioritise CTC scRNA-seq workflow standardisation, integrate ML-driven analysis and investigate rare and hybrid populations to advance metastasis research.

However, the process often suffers from subjectivity, environmental light variability, and the high cost or lack of standardization in instrumental methods. This study aims to develop a consistent and reliable tooth color prediction model using machine learning (ML) techniques, even under different clinical lights. In-vivo intraoral images of anterior teeth were collected from volunteer patients under five different clinical light sources. The teeth were annotated, segmented, and matched with corresponding color labels. LAB color space was used, and the CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) technique was applied to the L-channel to reduce light-induced glare. To address class imbalance, data augmentation was performed, resulting in a balanced dataset of 16,640 images. The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing subsets. Five ML algorithms-Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost-were evaluated. As a result of experimental studies, RF and XGBoost obtained the highest performance, both achieving an accuracy of 97% in predicting tooth color across different lighting scenarios. These results demonstrate the robustness of the approach under variable lighting conditions. This study demonstrates that ML algorithms combined with image enhancement techniques such as CLAHE can provide accurate and light-independent tooth color predictions. The proposed method offers a practical and low-cost tool to support clinical decision-making in prosthetic dentistry, potentially enhancing standardization and efficiency in color matching processes.",Lasers in medical science,,"['EsraEfitli', 'Abdullah AmmarKarcioglu', 'AlperOzdogan', 'FurkanKaratas', 'TubaSenocak']",,,PubMed,

To support autistic people in developing their social competence and communication abilities, we propose an interactive game specifically designed to enhance social understanding. By incorporating gamification elements and a user-centered design approach, the application aims to balance clinical relevance with high usability, ensuring it remains accessible, engaging, and beneficial for anyone seeking to improve their social skills.

Our study aimed to assess the static and dynamic performance of six modern NIV home ventilators and one intensive care unit (ICU) ventilator and to identify performance clusters among the devices.
A two-compartment lung model was connected to seven NIV ventilators (Sefam Stan, Philips A40, Philips DreamStation, Resmed Lumis 150, Löwenstein PrismaVent 30C, Löwenstein PrismaVent 40 and BellaVista 1000) in pressure-support mode. Static and dynamic (triggering and pressurisation) performances were assessed through three distinct clinical phenotypes and four levels of unintentional leak. Clustering analysis was performed using K-means.
For each of the seven ventilators, 144 conditions were tested, and a total of 3024 cycles were analysed. Static and dynamic performances were good to excellent across home ventilators, significantly higher than the ICU ventilator. Clustering analysis identified three performance clusters. Cluster 1 (Sefam Stan and Philips A40) showed significantly more precise accuracy of inspiratory pressure than Cluster 2 (Philips DreamStation, Resmed Lumis 150, Löwenstein PrismaVent 30C and Löwenstein PrismaVent 40) and Cluster 3 (BellaVista 1000): mean error=4.3%±5.1% versus 8.5%±6.7% versus 10.6%±14.7% respectively, p<0.001.

PILs were acquired from the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology Society of Europe website, reformatted, and uploaded to the GPT-4 user interface with a prompt aimed to simplify the language. Automated readability metrics were used to evaluate the readability of original and LLM-modified PILs. Factual accuracy was assessed by human evaluation from three consultant interventional radiologists using an agreed marking scheme.
LLM-modified PILs had significantly lower mean reading grade (9.5±0.5) compared with original PILs (11.1±0.1) (p<0.01). However, the recommended reading grade of 6 (expected to be understood by 11- to 12-year-old children) was not achieved. Human evaluation revealed that most LLM-modified PILs had minor concerns regarding factual accuracy, but no errors that could result in serious patient harm were detected.
LLMs appear to be a powerful tool in improving the readability of PILs within the field of interventional radiology. However, clinical experts are still required in PIL development to ensure the factual accuracy of these augmented documents is not compromised.
LLMs should be considered as a useful tool to assist with the development and revision of PILs in the field of interventional radiology.",BMJ health & care informatics,,"['WilliamClackett', 'Ian AZealley', 'ZeleiYang', 'GhaliSalahia', 'Richard DWhite']",,,PubMed,

Wearable and connected technologies combined with artificial intelligence (AI) can support real-time monitoring, personalized alerts, and proactive interventions. This review summarizes AI-enabled tools for allergy care spanning physiologic signals, environmental exposures (e.g., pollutant proxies such as particulates/VOCs), and patient behaviors, as well as connected medication-adherence technologies (e.g., digital inhalers) that integrate with the same analytics workflows. We also outline predictive algorithms that forecast exacerbations and briefly review therapeutic devices. Reported benefits include earlier warning of clinical deterioration, improved adherence/technique, and opportunities for tailored management. However, important limitations remain around data accuracy and reliability, user adoption, workflow integration, equity/fairness, privacy/cybersecurity, and evolving regulatory pathways. Critically, most devices and algorithms reviewed are investigational or early-phase, with evidence dominated by feasibility or short-term studies, and only a few show improvements in patient-centered outcomes in prospective trials. Realizing clinical value will require outcomes-focused validation (including external/pragmatic studies), safeguards for privacy and security, attention to bias and subgroup performance, and implementation models that fit clinical workflows and reimbursement.

DNA methylation offers a promising molecular signature, but its utility for tissue classification remains underexplored.
We harmonized publicly available DNA methylation datasets (GSE97784 and GSE204943; n = 142) and selected the top 100 most variable CpG sites (variance 0.074-0.117) for analysis. Eight supervised machine learning (ML) models-logistic regression, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), Naive Bayes, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and neural network (NN)-were trained using 10-fold cross-validation. Principal component analysis was performed to assess data dimensionality.
High-variance CpG sites were predominantly located within gene bodies and clustered on chromosomes 1, 2, and 6. PCA revealed complex, high-dimensional methylation patterns requiring 55 components to capture 90% of variance. Overall, RF achieved the highest accuracy (78%) and AUC-ROC (0.84), followed by GBM (76%) and XGBoost. Tumor and normal tissues were classified with relatively high sensitivity and specificity, while OPLs were difficult to detect, showing low sensitivity (<50%) across all models. GBM performed best for normal tissue detection, and Naive Bayes slightly outperformed for tumor F1-score, but RF offered the most balanced performance across classes.
Ensemble ML models, particularly RF and GBM, demonstrate proof-of-concept potential for DNA methylation-based classification of oral tissues.

To diagnose ccRCC and assess its prognosis more accurately, it is essential to screen novel prognostic biomarkers and construct prognostic signatures.MethodsImmune infiltration analysis of the TCGA cohort was performed via single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). The ccRCC cohort from the TCGA database was used to identify MDSC/Treg-related genes. Hub genes were selected from the common genes in the MDSC/Treg-related gene list via machine learning approaches. These hub genes were then employed to construct the risk signature through multivariate analysis.The prognostic performance, immune performance, and functional analysis of the signature were comprehensively assessed. Two independent GEO datasets were used to verify the major findings above. Potential drugs were screened to promote clinical transformation via the CellMiner platform.

Hence, applying machine learning-based virtual staining techniques for rapid generation of different mIHC markers has become a considerable alternative. The existing bio-image based virtual staining models generate the distributions of different markers independently, which have limited interpretability and overlook the fact that the exploration of potential interrelationships among these markers can help determine the localization of each individual marker. To address the above issues, we propose an explainable prototypical multi-task generation framework (i.e., ProtoMTG) to simultaneously generate multiple mIHC markers. Specifically, ProtoMTG involves a multi-task prototype layer that can capture the relationship among different virtual staining tasks by learning the shared and task-specific prototypes. Then, in the proto-attention layer, both task-specific and shared prototypes will be re-weighted and combined to instruct the generation of different mIHC markers. In ProtoMTG, we also design the novel prototypical activation and diversity losses to learn better prototype representation for the virtual staining task. To evaluate the performance of our method, we develop three benchmark mIHC datasets on different organs (i.e., colon, liver and stomach). The experimental results indicate that our method can not only outperform the existing image generation models, but also have good explainable ability for the virtual staining of mIHC markers.

,10.1371/journal.pone.0333070,Exploration common biomarkers and pathogenesis of primary Sjögren's syndrome and interstitial lung disease by machine learning and weighted gene co-expression networks.,"Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune and inflammatory disorder that may affect the lungs, leading to interstitial lung disease (ILD). However, the diagnosis of progression from pSS to ILD is frequently delayed due to unstandardized interdisciplinary diagnostic criteria and a lack of reliable shared biomarkers. This diagnostic challenge, compounded by significant pathophysiological divergence in target organs, has hindered elucidation of their comorbidity mechanisms. This study employs integrated bioinformatics to identify shared biomarkers in pSS and ILD, deciphers their pathogenic mechanisms, and predicts targeted therapeutics via network pharmacology.
From the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we retrieved gene expression profiles of pSS and ILD. Differential expression gene (DEG) analysis was performed on the profiles, followed by further screening using four machine learning algorithms. Concurrently, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to identify gene modules, and enrichment analysis of WGCNA-derived genes was conducted to explore their biological functions. Genes obtained from WGCNA and machine learning approaches were then intersected to identify candidate biomarkers for pSS-ILD. The diagnostic potential of these candidate genes was evaluated in both discovery and validation sets using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Finally, we performed immune cell infiltration analysis of candidate genes, regulatory network construction for transcription factor (TF)-gene and miRNA-gene interactions, drug-target prediction, and molecular docking coupled with molecular dynamics simulations for predicted drugs.
Differential expression analysis identified 25 shared genes between pSS and ILD gene expression profiles, with machine learning algorithms refining six key genes from these DEGs. WGCNA revealed 39 intersecting genes significantly enriched in biological processes including cell division, oocyte maturation, and metabolic regulation. Intersection of machine learning and WGCNA results yielded two hub genes (CYSLTR1 and SIGLEC10), both demonstrating robust diagnostic value in discovery and validation cohorts. Immune cell infiltration profiling showed: upregulation of activated CD4+ memory T cells and memory B cells; downregulation of resting NK cells. Regulatory network analysis indicated FOXC1, hsa-mir-27a-3p, hsa-mir-195-5p, and hsa-miR-26a-5p as potential coregulators of CYSLTR1 and SIGLEC10 expression. Finally, ten candidate drug compounds targeting the hub genes were prioritized, exemplified by:Rev-5901 (CTD 00002161), Zafirlukast (BOSS database) and Montelukast (CTD 00003205). Molecular docking demonstrated substantial binding affinity of both montelukast and zafirlukast for CYSLTR1, while molecular dynamics simulations further validated the stability of their complexes.
This study revealed that CYSLTR1 and SIGLEC10 demonstrate diagnostic potential for pSS-ILD. Their mechanism of action likely involves synergistically upregulating memory B cells to promote disease progression. Furthermore, we identified montelukast as a potential therapeutic agent.

Fixed-pattern voice signals were collected from 25 COPD patients and 25 RTI patients (serving as the control/comparison group). Multi-dimensional voice feature analysis was performed to identify features significantly differentiating the two groups. Statistically significant features were selected and subjected to dimensionality reduction. Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) models were then trained and evaluated for classification performance in distinguishing COPD from RTI. Over 400 voice features were initially analyzed. Eighteen features showed highly significant differences between COPD and RTI patients (P <; 0.05). In the task of distinguishing COPD patients from RTI patients, the LR model achieved a test set area under the curve AUC of 0.95, significantly outperforming the RF model (AUC = 0.76).

Despite available treatments, approximately one-third of patients exhibit resistance to standard approaches. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising intervention for both major depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD), yet response rates vary considerably among individuals. In recent years, machine learning (ML) models have been introduced to predict patient response to DBS, offering the potential to enhance patient selection and enable more personalized treatment strategies. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the guidelines put forth by PRISMA. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane) were searched to identify studies applying ML to predict response to DBS in patients with MDD/TRD. Six studies were included in the systematic review, comprising of 32 ML models, most commonly support vector machines (SVM) and Naïve Bayes classifiers. All DBS procedures targeted the subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCC). Input data included structural, functional, neuroelectrophysiological, and clinical information.
